UniQuad - University Database System

UniQuad is a centralized platform designed to enhance the student experience by integrating essential support systems, mentorship programs, and career assistance resources. 
This project involved developing a comprehensive and optimized database system to serve as the backbone for UniQuad's operations.

Project Overview :

The primary goal of this project was to engineer a robust and efficient database system capable of handling UniQuad's diverse data requirements while ensuring data integrity, minimizing redundancy, and optimizing storage and retrieval processes.

Key Features :

Normalized Database Design: Constructed an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) and translated it into a normalized relational database schema comprising 18 tables. Applied database normalization techniques up to the third normal form (3NF) to eliminate data redundancy and improve storage efficiency.

Query Optimization: Optimized complex SQL queries involving joins, correlated subqueries, and nested queries to enhance data processing speed and efficiency within the MySQL database environment.

Hybrid Database Integration: Demonstrated proficiency in both SQL and NoSQL databases by integrating the MySQL relational database with Neo4j, a graph database management system, enabling seamless data handling across diverse data models.

Data Processing Enhancements: Implemented advanced SQL techniques to efficiently process and analyze the dataset, ensuring optimal performance.

Technologies Used :

Database Management Systems: MySQL, Neo4j

Query Languages: SQL, Cypher (Neo4j query language)

Database Design: Entity-Relationship Modeling, Database Normalization
